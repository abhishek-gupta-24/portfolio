          This portfolio website showcases my skills and projects as a web
          developer. Designed with a modern aesthetic and a user-friendly
          interface, it serves as a digital resume. The website features a
          responsive design, ensuring it looks great on all devices, and
          includes detailed project showcases with links to live demos. A
          contact form enables easy communication for potential clients, while a
          dedicated section highlights my technical skills. Technologies used
          include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Looking ahead, I plan to enhance
          the portfolio by adding animations, optimizing performance, and
          expanding the project showcase.<br /><button>

          <div class="title">Simon Says Game</div>
          The Simon Says Game is a fun memory game where players replicate a
          growing sequence of colors. The game becomes more challenging as the
          sequence length increases with each round. If a player makes a
          mistake, the game restarts. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it
          features a high score tracker to keep a record of the playerâ€™s best
          performance, along with smooth animations and responsive design for
          all devices. The game also offers real-time feedback to guide players
          through each level

          This Blog Website enables users to create, read, update, and delete
          (CRUD) blog posts. Users can write new posts, edit existing ones, and
          delete entries as needed, all through a clean and intuitive interface.
          Built using Express.js for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
          for the frontend, the project currently uses local data storage to
          manage posts. In future updates, a database will be integrated to
          handle persistent storage. The site is fully responsive, providing a
          seamless experience on all devices. Future enhancements include adding
          a database, user authentication, and post categorization to improve
          functionality.<br /><button>
